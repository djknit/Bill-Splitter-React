# Data (State)

## This Directory
This directory holds data that is used throughout the app. Data that is only required for a specific component and it's children is located in that component's own directory.

## Attribution
I got the general idea that I am using for these data stores from the following source.

This source also introduced me to the 'events' module and it's usage.
